# Nutanix Kalm & Persistent Volume Claim

This Nutanix Kalm blueprint will create a Persistent Volume Claim and deploy a BusyBox pod to mount the volume.

**Note:** The reason to call it Kalm, Kubernetes Application Lifecycle Management, is because this blueprint is a Kubernetes application. The Nutanix product name is Calm, this is just to difference if we are talking about a native Kubernetes app.

## Mandatory Requirements Section

- Created on Prism Central 5.16.1.  Tested on 5.16.1
- Minimum Calm version is 2.9.8
- A Kubernetes cluster is required (This blueprint uses a Karbon K8s cluster)
- The project must have configured a Kubernetes cluster
- Tested on Nutanix Karbon 2.0 only but should work the same way on any platform that supports native Kubernetes API
- Minimum hardware requirements: few resources, CPU and memory, available on your Kubernetes cluster
- Variables: kube_namespace, kube_pvc_name, kube_pvc_storageClass, kube_pvc_accessMode, kube_pvc_size, kube_calm_sa_token, kubemaster_ip
  - **kube_calm_sa_token**. A Kubernetes service account is required for Calm to interact with the Kubernetes cluster (more details below)
- Credentials: there is a dummy credential. Just complete the password with a dummy one too.
- Minimum # of Pods required: 1
- Actions: Default
- Custom actions: Scale Out i.e. scale out from 1 to 2 BusyBox pods. When scaling out the PVC is only mounted to a single pod.
- License information: No licenses required
- Network information: Kubernetes environment will require Internet connection for image downloads

## Components

- 1x BusyBox pod (persistent)

## Prerequisites

To deploy this blueprint you will need the following things available:

- A Kubernetes cluster with native API (Preferable Karbon because Dynamic Storage Provisioning)
- A Kubernetes service account for Calm (more details below)
- A Calm project with a Kubernetes cluster (Karbon in this example)
- A Kubernetes namespace must exists before you can deploy the application (this is using the default namespace)

## Usage

- Create the Kubernetes service account for Calm

  - Create account
  
  ```shell
  kubectl apply -f Calm_serviceAccount.yaml
  ```

  - Retrieve token. Copy the token that the following command will ouput and use it as value for **kube_calm_sa_token** variable.
  
  ```shell
  kubectl -n default describe secret calm-karbon-secret
  ```

- Import the blueprint into your Nutanix Calm environment
- Adjust the Kubernetes cluster in the pods
- Launch the blueprint
- Fill in all required runtime variables.
- After deployment, run *kubectl* to retrieve the Kubernetes pod
- Connect to the running pod with *kubectl exec -it <pod_name> sh*
- In the pod shell, run *df -h* to list the disks and partitions. You will see the PVC mounted in the path /var/lib/mysql
- The BusyBox pod has a sleep of 1000 seconds. After this time the pod is destroyed.

## Support

These blueprints are *unofficial* and are not supported or maintained by Nutanix in any way.
